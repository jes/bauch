Bauch-style Lego Artwork Generator
----------------------------------

Andy Bauch made some Lego art pieces encoding Bitcoin keys.

You can look at them on his website: https://andybauch.com/

I solved the encoding scheme and won some of the money: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/andy-bauch-lego-bitcoin.html

This tool helps you create similar pieces.

The default configuration is meant to match Andy's "Bitcoin initially valued at $60".
